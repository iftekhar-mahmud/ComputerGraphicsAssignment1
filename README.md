Question: Design a game with two enemies and two agents. The game will end when both agents will get destroyed by any enemy. An agent gets destroyed when it gets hit by an enemy. 

The movement path of the enemy is given in the diagram. The agents can be moved up and down  or left and right to protect them from the enemy. 

The score is the number of times the “animate” function gets called. When the game finishes the score will be shown in the console.
